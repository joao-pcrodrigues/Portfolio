# Portefolio

This project consists in the creation of my online portefolio.
I'm currently in the middle of my web development course and after some research, building  a portfolio is one of the best ways to showcase what I'm capable of as a developer and possibly attract new projects.

This project was built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
